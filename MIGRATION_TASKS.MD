# Cut-and-Track MRP Migration Tasks

> **Last Updated: May 17, 2025**

This document centralizes all tasks related to migrating the Cut-and-Track MRP application from cloud-based services to a fully local hosting solution for ITAR compliance in aerospace CNC machine shops.

## Migration Overview

The Cut-and-Track MRP application is being migrated from cloud services (primarily Supabase) to a fully local implementation to comply with ITAR regulations, which require all data to remain within the controlled local environment.

## Current Focus (May 17, 2025)

The current focus is on completing the authentication system migration and fixing the login functionality. Key tasks include:

1. Fixing the login error: `ReferenceError: signInWithPassword is not defined`
2. Ensuring the local API client is properly integrated with the authentication system
3. Testing the authentication flow end-to-end
4. Updating UI components to work with the local API response format

## Known Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Error: "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND postgres" when trying to connect to the database
   - Need to verify Docker network configuration and database container settings

2. **Login Functionality**
   - Error: `ReferenceError: signInWithPassword is not defined`
   - Supabase authentication functions need to be fully replaced with local equivalents

3. **UI Component Compatibility**
   - Some UI components may still expect Supabase-specific data structures
   - Need to update components to work with local API response format

## Test Credentials

For development and testing purposes, use the following admin credentials:

- Email: `admin@cutandtrack.local`
- Password: `admin123`

## ITAR Compliance Verification

The following must be verified to ensure ITAR compliance:

1. **Data Isolation**: All data must remain on the local server with no external transmission
2. **Authentication**: All user authentication must be handled locally
3. **File Storage**: All files must be stored on the local server
4. **API Services**: No external API services can be used
5. **Development Tools**: No cloud-based development tools can send data externally

## Deployment Instructions

Once all migration tasks are complete, follow these steps for production deployment:

1. Update environment variables with production values
2. Build production Docker images
3. Deploy to the local production server
4. Configure regular backups
5. Implement monitoring
6. Train users on the new system
