# Test Plan for Work Order Issue Fixes

## Testing Approach
This document outlines the test scenarios to verify the fixes for the three critical issues. Testing should be performed in both development and staging environments.

## 1. Part Selection Failure Test Cases

### 1.1 Basic Part Selection
1. Navigate to Add Work Order page
2. Select a customer from the dropdown
3. Click on the part selection dropdown
4. Select any part from the list
5. **Expected:** Part should be selected without errors

### 1.2 Edge Cases
1. Create a scenario where parts load slowly (use network throttling or mock a delayed API response)
2. Click on part dropdown before data is fully loaded
3. **Expected:** Should show "Loading parts..." and not crash

### 1.3 Partial Data Test
1. Create test data with parts missing name or part number
2. Add a new work order and select one of these parts
3. **Expected:** UI should render with fallback text (e.g., "Unknown" or "No part number")

## 2. Edit Work Order Form Load Tests

### 2.1 Standard Edit Flow
1. Create a work order with all fields populated
2. Navigate to the edit page for this work order
3. **Expected:** Form should load with all fields pre-populated

### 2.2 Missing Related Entity Data
1. Using database tools, create a work order with a reference to a non-existent customer or part
2. Try to load the edit page for this work order
3. **Expected:** Should show a clear error message about missing data rather than a blank page or generic error

### 2.3 Race Condition Testing
1. Create a network condition with high latency
2. Navigate to edit work order page
3. **Expected:** Should show loading state and eventually load the form or display a specific error message

## 3. Command Component "Not Iterable" Tests

### 3.1 Empty Component Testing
1. Navigate to any page with a Command component (part search dropdown)
2. Trigger a state where no items are in the list
3. **Expected:** Should render an empty state message rather than crashing

### 3.2 Component Mount/Unmount Test
1. Rapidly navigate to and away from pages with Command components
2. **Expected:** No console errors related to "undefined is not iterable"

### 3.3 Stress Test
1. Repeatedly open and close dropdown menus that use the Command component
2. **Expected:** UI should remain stable with no errors

## 4. General Integration Tests

### 4.1 Create Work Order End-to-End
1. Start a new work order
2. Select customer
3. Select part 
4. Fill all required fields
5. Submit the form
6. **Expected:** Work order should be created successfully

### 4.2 Edit Work Order End-to-End
1. Navigate to an existing work order
2. Click edit
3. Modify several fields
4. Save changes
5. **Expected:** All changes should be saved correctly

### 4.3 Form Validation
1. Try submitting forms with invalid or missing data
2. **Expected:** Appropriate validation errors should display without crashing the app

## 5. Regression Testing

### 5.1 Customer Selection
1. Verify customer selection dropdown works properly in all contexts
2. **Expected:** No errors when selecting customers

### 5.2 Form Resets
1. Fill in a form, then reset it
2. **Expected:** Form should reset to initial values without errors

### 5.3 Different Screen Sizes
1. Test all fixed functionality on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
2. **Expected:** Components should adapt to different screen sizes without errors

## Test Data Requirements
- Work orders with complete data
- Work orders with missing customer information
- Work orders with missing part information
- Parts with missing fields (name or part number)
- Customers with minimal information

## Test Environments
1. Local development environment
2. Staging environment (before deploying to production)
3. Production environment (smoke tests after deployment)
