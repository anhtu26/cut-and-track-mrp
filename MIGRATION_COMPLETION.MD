# ITAR-Compliant Migration Completion Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to complete the remaining tasks for the Cut-and-Track MRP application migration to fully local hosting for aerospace CNC machine shop ITAR compliance.

## Remaining Migration Steps


Useful Commands
I've added several npm scripts to make working with the development environment easier:

npm run docker:dev:up - Start the development environment
npm run docker:dev:down - Stop the development environment
npm run docker:dev:logs - View logs from all containers
npm run docker:dev:rebuild - Rebuild and restart containers (use when changing dependencies)



### Step 1: Finalize Docker Configuration

The Docker environment needs final adjustments to ensure proper communication between services:

```bash
# Test the Docker configuration
docker-compose config

# Build the containers
docker-compose build

# Start the services
docker-compose up
```

#### Docker Networking Checklist
- [ ] Verify API server container can connect to Postgres container
- [ ] Ensure the frontend container can reach the API server
- [ ] Check that local file storage is properly mounted

### Step 2: Verify Database Initialization

The database initialization must be tested to ensure all schema and data are properly set up:

```bash
# Check database logs during startup
docker-compose logs postgres

# Connect to the database and verify tables
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d mrp_db -c "\dt"

# Verify seed data
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d mrp_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users"
```

#### Database Verification Checklist
- [ ] All tables created successfully
- [ ] Seed data properly loaded
- [ ] User authentication data migrated
- [ ] Schema matches application requirements

### Step 3: Test Local Authentication Service

The JWT-based authentication system needs thorough testing:

```bash
# Test login endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"admin@precisionflow.us","password":"your_test_password"}'

# Verify JWT token is generated
# Test protected routes with JWT token
```

#### Authentication Checklist
- [ ] User login works correctly
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Protected routes enforce authentication
- [ ] User session management functions properly

### Step 4: Validate Local API Services

All API services should be tested to ensure they function as expected:

```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3002/api/workorders/recent
curl http://localhost:3002/api/customers
curl http://localhost:3002/api/parts
```

#### API Services Checklist
- [ ] All endpoints return expected data
- [ ] CRUD operations work for all resources
- [ ] Error handling is implemented correctly
- [ ] API responses match frontend expectations

### Step 5: Verify File Storage

Local file storage must be tested to ensure proper operation:

```bash
# Test file upload
curl -X POST -F "file=@test_file.pdf" http://localhost:3002/api/storage/upload -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test file download
curl http://localhost:3002/storage/FILENAME.pdf -o downloaded_file.pdf
```

#### File Storage Checklist
- [ ] File uploads work correctly
- [ ] File downloads function properly
- [ ] File metadata is stored in the database
- [ ] File access is properly secured

### Step 6: End-to-End Testing

Perform comprehensive testing of the entire application:

1. Start the application with `docker-compose up`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081 in a browser
3. Test the following workflows:
   - User login/logout
   - Work order management
   - Parts inventory
   - Customer information
   - File uploads/downloads
   - Reporting features
   
#### E2E Testing Checklist
- [ ] All UI elements render correctly
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Data is saved to the local database
- [ ] Files are stored locally
- [ ] No external API calls are made

### Step 7: Performance and Security Testing

Ensure the application performs well and is secure:

```bash
# Check for any external connections
docker-compose exec api-server netstat -tuna

# Check API server logs for errors
docker-compose logs api-server
```

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] All data stays within the local network
- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed
- [ ] API endpoints are secured with authentication
- [ ] No external calls are made (ITAR compliance)
- [ ] Error logs don't expose sensitive information

### Step 8: Documentation Update

Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture and deployment process:

- [ ] Update installation instructions
- [ ] Document the local database schema
- [ ] Provide operational guides for maintenance
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document ITAR compliance measures

## ITAR Compliance Verification

The following should be verified to ensure ITAR compliance:

1. **Data Isolation**: All data must remain on the local server with no external transmission
2. **Authentication**: All user authentication is handled locally
3. **File Storage**: All files are stored on the local server
4. **API Services**: No external API services are used
5. **Development Tools**: No cloud-based development tools send data externally

## Deployment Process

Once all testing is complete, follow these steps for production deployment:

1. Update environment variables with production values
2. Build production Docker images
3. Deploy to the local production server
4. Configure regular backups
5. Implement monitoring
6. Train users on the new system

With these steps completed, the Cut-and-Track MRP application will be fully migrated to a local hosting solution that complies with ITAR requirements for the aerospace CNC machine shop.
