# Part Selector Component Rebuild

## Overview

This document outlines the complete rebuild of the Part Selector component using shadcn/ui's Command component pattern. This rebuild was necessary due to critical bugs in the previous implementation:

1. The search bar didn't update properly when a part was selected (still showed "Select Part")
2. When typing in the search bar, the UI would go blank with an error:
   ```
   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')
   ```

## Changes Made

1. Completely rewrote the `PartSelector` component using a proper shadcn/ui Command pattern
2. Fixed the nested structure of Command components to ensure proper rendering
3. Added appropriate CommandList to wrap CommandItems
4. Removed the dependency on ref-based DOM manipulation which was causing the error
5. Added proper defensive code to handle edge cases and potential null/undefined values
6. Improved the visual feedback when selecting items
7. Standardized UI labels and strings

## Key Implementation Details

- Used shadcn/ui's Command component properly with CommandList
- Improved error handling throughout the component
- Added proper loading states and empty states
- Ensured proper form field integration with react-hook-form
- Updated the tests to verify the component works correctly

## Testing

The component has been thoroughly tested:

1. Unit tests cover all major functionality
2. Manual testing verified that the search functionality works properly
3. Edge cases (empty data, loading states, etc.) have been tested

Run the included test script to verify:

```bash
# On Windows
test-part-selector.bat

# On macOS/Linux
chmod +x test-part-selector.sh
./test-part-selector.sh
```

## Benefits of This Rebuild

1. **Increased Reliability**: The component now handles all edge cases properly
2. **Improved Performance**: Eliminated DOM manipulation and optimized rendering
3. **Better UX**: Clearer feedback for users with consistent behavior
4. **Maintainability**: Code is now easier to understand and modify
5. **Future-proof**: Uses standard shadcn/ui patterns that are well-tested
