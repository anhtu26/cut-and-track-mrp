# Supabase to Local API Migration Progress

## Migration Status: In Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating the Cut-and-Track MRP application from Supabase to a fully local API implementation for ITAR compliance.

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ **Replaced Supabase client with error-throwing proxy**
   - Created a proxy object that throws errors when Supabase client is used
   - Added deprecation warnings to guide developers to use the local API client

2. ‚úÖ **Updated authentication system**
   - Implemented local authentication using JWT tokens
   - Added user role endpoint to the server API
   - Updated useAuth hook to use local API client
   - Fixed login/logout functionality to work with local API

3. ‚úÖ **Removed Supabase imports across codebase**
   - Replaced all imports from '@/integrations/supabase/client' with local API client
   - Updated all references from supabase.X to apiClient.X

4. ‚úÖ **Created test scripts**
   - Added authentication test script to verify local API functionality
   - Added script to create test admin user for development

## Remaining Tasks

1. üîÑ **Update UI components**
   - Some UI components may still expect Supabase-specific data structures
   - Need to ensure all components work with the local API response format

2. üîÑ **Update storage functionality**
   - Replace Supabase storage with local file storage
   - Update document upload/download functionality

3. üîÑ **Comprehensive testing**
   - Test all functionality with local API
   - Verify no external API calls are being made

## Test Credentials

For development and testing purposes, use the following admin credentials:

- Email: `admin@cutandtrack.local`
- Password: `admin123`

## Known Issues

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Database connection issues**
   - The local database connection needs to be configured correctly
   - Error: "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND postgres" when trying to connect to the database

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Login error**
   - The login functionality needs further testing
   - May need to update the local API client to match the server's response format

## Next Steps

1. Fix database connection issues
2. Complete the UI component updates
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Verify ITAR compliance with no external API calls
